# Fall 2021 - Spring 2022: Student Retention and Engagement

During my second year in GLP, I had the chance to apply HCD internally to improve the program. As part of the Student Retention and Engagement committee, my task was to set up GLP for long-term success: make sure students stay in the program and find ways to recruit new students.

In order to do this, my committee created a comprehensive marketing plan, along with laying the groundwork for an extensive social media presence. Included with this were brand guidelines, official typography, and official color palettes. We also created the first ever merchandise for the program after hosting an internal merch design competition.

My proudest accomplishment with this group, however, was pioneering the Professional Development Lab (PDL). The PDL is a comprehensive professional development workshop that I custom-made for GLP. The session includes information on professional development essentials like email signatures, business attire, LinkedIn and Handshake profiles, and elevator pitches, along with a resume workshop and professional headshots. The PDL continues to be an annual event within GLP that acts as a one-stop-shop for new cohorts to set themselves up for professsional success.

This experience taught me skills in:

1. Project management since this was the first time in GLP that we acted completely independently and had to create and manage our own projects.
2. Budgeting and proposal writing since any events we hosted had to be approved in advance and budgeted for.
3. Presentation and professional development through the extensive and tailor-made Professional Development Lab.
