- The Active Law-enforcement Mixed-strategy Allocator (ALMA) is a game-theoretic system to determine the optimal police patrol routes for the University of Illinois Police Department. The aim of this project is to use real-world data to explore possibilities to make our campus safer. Using a combination of existing Stackelberg Security Games (SSG) research and information from the police department, we uniquely create a program that creates patrol schedules that outperform random simulations.

- There are a variety of interested questions concerning the uniform distribution and rigidity of sequences in the interval [0, 1]. These topics have been studied for many decades, but there still remain challenging open problems. Using theoretical methods and computational tools, we created a novel algorithm that quantifies the probability that a sequence will be uniformly distributed by an analysis of the distributions of its fractional parts.
