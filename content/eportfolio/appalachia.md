Over the winter of 2022, I had the chance to travel to the [Binns-Counts Community Center](https://www.binnscounts.org/)
in McClure, Virginia. This was a standout experience in GLP because I truly got to see the underbelly of America.

During this three-day trip, we travelled to various towns in the Appalachians, learning about their culture
and meeting the people. In particular, we attended a bluegrass concert, visited a local church, and went to a the Mountain Hertiage Museum. The main purpose of the trip was service learning, and over multiple days,
we helped renovate and rebuild local houses in the community.

This was one of the biggest learning experiences I've had in GLP. It made me closer with our GLP community, but also
gave me a lot of insights into the Appalachian region and the hardships it's peoples have faced for decades.
