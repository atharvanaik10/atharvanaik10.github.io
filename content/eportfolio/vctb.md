title: "Spring 2023: HCD Crash Course"
---

In Spring 2023, me and a team of GLP students worked with VC_TB, a Brazillian language
learning app in order to help them better understand and implement HCD into their everyday
internal and external operations. This research aimed to provide practical recommendations for the company to integrate a
human-centered design approach that puts users at the center of their services and problem-solving practices.
Human-Centered design (HCD) is an approach to design that prioritizes the needs, preferences, and experiences
of users and stakeholders. It involves engaging with recipients throughout the design process to understand their
needs and gather feedback. It uses that information to create products and services that meet their needs and are
easy and enjoyable to use. In the context of the language exchange industry, the importance of HCD cannot be
overstated. Language exchange is a service industry that revolves around communication and interaction
between people from different cultures and backgrounds. Therefore, understanding the needs and preferences of
users is crucial for providing effective services that facilitate language learning and cultural exchange. By
integrating a human-centered design framework into their everyday practices and problem-solving apparatus,
VC_TB can ensure that their services are tailored to the needs of their students and partner clientele.

Overall, the findings shared suggested that implementing a human-centered design approach could be
beneficial for the company in addressing the issues with communication and teacher no-shows, as well as
improving the well-being and job satisfaction of its employees. By prioritizing the needs and preferences of
users and employees, the company can improve its services, differentiate itself from competitors, and ultimately
increase its market share and revenue.

Most importantly, we provided a [crash course on HCD frameworks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBzwMSSliFV_VS6YsZ_5tAkeuNyfU0rm6) that aimed to help the company understand the benefits of adopting an HCD approach and how to implement it in their everyday practices.
