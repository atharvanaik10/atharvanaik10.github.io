title: "Spring 2023: Annual Conference on the First-Year Experience"
---

In my junior year of GLP, I had the honor of being selected as one of three students in the program to present at the prestigous [Annual Conference on the First-Year Experience](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/national_resource_center/events/conferences/first-year_experience) hosted in Los Angeles by the University of South Carolina.

When we arrived at the conference in LA, we quickly realized that we were some of the only students there. Regardless of this fact, our presence in various conference sessions was welcomed, and our unique perspective was respected. During our presentation itself, we had a great turnout, with our audience curious to know more about student experiences and the value of peer leadership.

Making the GLP interview video was an idea we had to be able to get real and unfiltered student perspectives about the program. The process of creating the video itself was challenging due to our accelerated timeline. From the birth of the idea to its implementation, we had less than two weeks to come up with a storyboard and interview script and film the video itself. We had to rent equipment from the Main Library, set it up, and recruit students to film at the SCD. Some of the big challenges we faced were transporting heavy equipment and getting students to film. Thankfully, we set up only one day to film, and it was right after a GLP event, guaranteeing us engagement.

Filming the video itself was my favorite memory from the whole process. As someone who did a lot of filmmaking in high school, I was able to relive some of the moments and reuse some of the technology that I used in high school. Furthermore, it was great to hear positive feedback about GLP from our fellow cohorts.
