title: "Fall 2022: Illinois Global Summit"
---

Because of my involvement in GLP, I was selected as one of the [only student moderators](https://publish.illinois.edu/global-strategy/global-summit/speaker-biographies/)
for the Illinois Global Summit. This was a one-day symposium upholding the Vision 2030 Global Strategy, and I was in charge of moderating the final panel of the symposium titled "Supporting Youth Development for Global Change."
This panel discussed how fostering youth engagement across disciplines is critical to developing the next generation of global problem solvers.

I enjoyed moderating the panel, and I was able to ask probing questions to the panelists from the student perspective,
a unique perspective considering most of the attendees were administrators. I was also able to connect with high level
administration like Sarah Morris, the Associate Vice Chancellor for Advancement, and LAS Dean Venetria Patton.
