For my capstone project, I served as the TA for the LAS 195 and LAS 399 GLP classes. I was the primary instructor for LAS 195 and handled all workshop logistics, grading, and project support. I also presented a 90-minute interactive workshop on tech for social good. For LAS 399, I facilitated in-class discussions and presented a 90-minute interactive professional interview workshop.

## Learnings as a TA

1. Presentation skills by leading two workshops - one on Tech for Social Good and one on Professional Interviews. Itâ€™s important to note that what I learned from these workshops was vastly different because of the stark genres of each of these. The Tech for Social Good workshop was an informative workshop designed to highlight the uses of technology in social innovation. This taught me presentation skills, as well as answering questions. The Professional Interview workshop was a dedicated professional development event that was much more hands-on and interactive. This workshop gave me experience in dispersing professional development, leading activities, and giving feedback.

2. Social innovation by acting as a resource for design challenge projects. In particular, I held an open-lab session during an off-week class period to support students. I also met one-on-one with each design challenge team outside of class time to check-in and provide resources like HCD frameworks, interview connections, and research papers.

3. Project management by acting as a liaison between mentors, community partners, and students. I reviewed progress reports from both mentors and students, and provided feedback and asked probing questions to encourage both groups to critically think about next steps.

4. Administration by supporting various events and initiatives within GLP. I revamped and organized the Slack channel for streamlined communication. I will host and facilitate the entire Social Innovation Forum on April 20th. I also designed the GLP graduation certificate and lapel pin.
